        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My interest in Interactive Media Design sparked last year when I was looking for a program to get me into Game Design. The only available one was in Toronto, at Humber College but it was a one year certificate, so when I found IMD, I decided to take this to have experience in not only design, but a bit of development. I live in a family of nerds, my mom does governement web stuff, can never remember the actual title, but she also runs a conference every year called CanUX, which is a big User Experience confrence, kind of like ted talks, but UX focused. My dad doesn't currently work in tech, but he has coded some programs for some of his jobs and coded our smart house system. </p>
        <p>For extra curriculars, I don't do much, but I work at a Rexall Drug Store as a Sales Clerk and I workout in my home gym or on one of my bikes, a BMX I bought from an old co-worker or my dad's old 7 speed mountain bike. I go out with friends a lot and listen to a lot of music. I own 2 guitars and a keyboard I rarely play anymore but want to get back into. I've been a gamer for 10 years as well, because of my dad, but for the last year, I've outreached my gaming and turned it into content on multiple social media platforms, including Instagram and YouTube. I make videos in the "cut commentary" format on games like Call of Duty and Apex Legends and have been doing so for almost a year. In that time period, I've gained 300 new followers over 5 platforms and racked in 20,000 channel views on YouTube.+</p>
